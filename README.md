# Titanic-Project (Exploring Data Preprocessing Techniques)

The first journey of the unsinkable ship ended in disaster. Controversial film. Sadly, the Titanic. Data scientists like myself can put a lot of our expertise to use on Kaggle's offered data because it is relatively clean. Exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning methods, and machine learning algorithms would all benefit from being applied to this dataset. The field of data science is not exclusive to academics and those with advanced degrees. Anyone is capable of doing this, and I'd want to explain the process I used to complete this Kaggle competition. Since the Titanic is so pervasive in modern culture, anyone can pick up this dataset and start playing around with it. Let's dive in right now!

I improved data processing, to obtain better accuracies for all these classification modelsby following below seven specific aims.

Classifying. There may be a need to sort our data into categories. The implications or association of various classes with our solution objective may also be of interest.

Correlating. The problem can be tackled in a number of ways depending on the features that are present in the training dataset. Which characteristics of the dataset have the greatest bearing on achieving our objective? Is there a link between a feature and the expected outcome of the solution, statistically speaking? Does the state of the solution shift when the feature values shift, or vice versa? Both numerical and categorical variables of the provided dataset are suitable for testing this hypothesis. In addition to determining survival rate connection, we may also wish to identify correlation among parameters relevant to following goals and workflow stages. Some aspects may be easier to create, complete, or rectify if they are correlated with one another.

Converting. The data preparation phase precedes the modeling phase. All features may need to be transformed to numerical equivalents, depending on the model algorithm selected. For instance, transforming nominal values into categories in text.

Completing. Estimating missing values within a feature may also be necessary during data preparation. When there are no blanks in a data set, model methods may perform better.

Correcting. If there are errors or potentially inaccurate values within features in the provided training dataset, we may attempt to correct them or remove the samples that include them from further consideration. One approach is to search for anomalies in the data we've collected. If a feature does not contribute to the analysis or could drastically distort the outcomes, we may decide to ignore it entirely.

Creating. Is it possible to build new features on top of preexisting ones while still achieving the desired levels of correlation, conversion, and fullness?

Charting. Determine the best visualization plots and charts to use based on the type of data and the desired outcomes of the solution.
